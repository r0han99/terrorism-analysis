# Chronicles of Global Terrorism and Analysis
A research based approach to study the details about chronicles of terrorism through historical data.

## Abstract 


_The one threat for the humanity which induces cynical belief on reality being peaceful is Terrorism. it disrupts the parameters of societal norms such as the law and order. With civilisations transcending in technology societal well being is still subpar. There has never been a single reason behind terrorism. Some of the major causes that come as an intersection of various researcher’s work include reasons like supremacy - the state of being superior to all others in terms of authority, power, status, etc. Events of terrorism are arbitrary to point which it’s unpredictable by any sophisticated predictive modelling. with Structured Data about all these events, though the triggers for terrorism are on the the psychological level, through statistical analysis, potential patterns to the cause can be analysed. Our main goal in this research paper is to put forward a statistical model to analyse and evaluate the subtle patterns to the causes based on a database consisting of records of various terrorist activities in the past since 1970. A Well Drafted Statistical Models and patterns will be of paramount for any posterity to preemptively act on situations based on the derived insights from an analysis._
