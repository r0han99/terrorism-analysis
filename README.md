# Chronicles of Global Terrorism and Analysis
A research based approach to study the details about chronicles of terrorism through historical data.

## Abstract 


_The one threat to humanity that induces negative belief in reality, being peaceful, is terrorism. It disrupts the parameters of societal norms such as law and order. With civilizations transcending in technology, societal well-being is still subpar. There has never been a single reason behind terrorism. Some of the significant causes that come as an intersection of various researcher's work include reasons like supremacy - the state of being superior to all others in terms of authority, power, status. With Structured Data about all these events, though the triggers for terrorism are on the psychological level, potential patterns to the cause can be analyzed through pattern recognition and statistical analysis. This primary goal is to put forward a statistical model to analyze and evaluate the subtle patterns and the likelihood of the causes based on a database consisting of historical records of various terrorist activities in the past since 1970. A factual inference from these Statistical Models and patterns will be paramount for any posterity to preemptively act on situations based on an analysis's derived insights._
